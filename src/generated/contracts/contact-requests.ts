/**
 * The public contact form, and the queue staff work it from.
 *
 * Two things shape these types. First, the endpoint is **public and
 * unauthenticated**, so the submit shape is the smallest thing that can carry an
 * enquiry and nothing that could be used to set state — no status, no assignee,
 * no ids.
 *
 * Second, this is **not a messaging feature**. Staff reply from their own mail
 * client, and what is recorded here is who owns an enquiry and what came of it.
 * There is deliberately no reply body in either direction: storing one side of a
 * conversation invites the reader to believe it is the whole of it.
