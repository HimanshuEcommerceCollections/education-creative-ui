/**
 * Booking request contract — the shape a parent's booking form submits and the
 * API validates. One definition, enforced on both sides.
 *
 * The model this encodes (ARCHITECTURE.md §8, locked): the parent **pays at the
 * time of booking**, a **coordinator then confirms** and assigns an educator,
 * and only then does the session reach the educator. Two consequences run
 * through the field names:
 *
 * 1. Everything the parent chooses about *who* and *when* is a **request**, not
 *    a reservation — `educatorSlug` is who they'd like, `preferredDate` /
 *    `preferredTime` are when they'd like it. Nothing is held. At launch the
 *    coordinator is the conflict check (materialised availability slots and the
 *    overlap constraint are a deferred fast-follow), so honest naming here is
 *    what keeps the UI copy honest too.
 * 2. No money crosses this boundary. There is deliberately no `total` field —
 *    the amount is computed server-side from the quote (§7) and never accepted
 *    from a client. The browser may render an estimate; it may not name a price.
 *
 * Learner details are collected here, before payment, which is exactly why the
 * `learner_data` consent is part of *this* request rather than the checkout: the
 * COPPA basis requires consent captured at the moment child data is first
 * entered (§4).
