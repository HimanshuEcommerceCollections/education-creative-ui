 * - `verificationStatus` is the child-safety invariant (§5). A booking cannot be
 *   confirmed, and no learner detail may be released, unless it is `approved`.
 *   Nothing but the staff endpoint in `educator.routes.ts` moves it.
 * - `subjects` is the authoritative list of what an educator teaches. The
 *   booking form offers exactly these strings and the quote path rejects a topic
 *   that isn't among them, so an empty list is not a neutral default — it is a
