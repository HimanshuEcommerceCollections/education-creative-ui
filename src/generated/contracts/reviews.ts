/**
 * Reviews — what a parent says about a session that actually happened.
 *
 * The rule the whole feature rests on (ARCHITECTURE.md §6): a review is anchored
 * to one **completed** booking, one review per booking, so a rating on a public
 * page can always be traced to a session someone paid for and an educator taught.
 * That is enforced by a NOT NULL UNIQUE `booking_id` in the schema rather than by
 * anything here; these shapes only decide what may be said and what may be read.
 *
 * Nothing in the public shapes identifies a family. A reviewer is an initial and
 * the age band of the learner — the same two facts the design has always shown —
 * because a parent writing about their child's tutor should not be findable from
 * the review, and the learner's name is encrypted at rest precisely so it never
 * reaches a page like this.
